I didn&apos;t really know how it worked. And it took half an hour to compile. Why? I used <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> (which is great), and compiled Pandoc from source (which I don&apos;t recommend). I&apos;ve seriously enjoyed playing with <a href="https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864">TCR</a>. Technically, TCR nudges you to minimize the time from having your code in one working state, to having your code in another working state. I wanted something similar, but with the flexibility of playing around with raw HTML, and raw CSS.</p><p><em>How does it work?</em> I write straignt into an <a>EDN file</a>. If anyone wants to learn structural editing, writing a blog post in EDN is great exercise. Then the <a>build system</a> picks up the data, dispatching based on metadata in the EDN file. Finally, an <a>HTML file</a> is produced.</p><p>Nods of appreciation for inspiration to Magnar Sveen, Jack Rusher (simple Clojure HTML approaches), Oddmund Str√∏mme (TCR &amp; discussions).</p><p>View this page on web: <a href="https://subcons.teod.eu/simple-static/" target="_blank">https://subcons.teod.eu/simple-static/</a></p></section></main></body></html>
