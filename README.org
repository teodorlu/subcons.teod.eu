#+TITLE: Readme

* Local development
Requirements:

- Clojure. Static site generation system.
- Nodejs. Only for =live-server= - which is used for local development

To work on EDN files producing HTML, simply

#+begin_src
bin/watch &
bin/live-server
#+end_src

. We keep HTML version controlled, so when you've made changes, simply check in
the changed HTML and push. There is no remote builder -- this folder is simply
served as-is.
* How to view live server output on a mobile device
You can view the live server directly on a mobile device, just find the local
network IP of the computer you're using.

#+begin_src
$ ifconfig -a | grep wlp0s20f3 -A 5

Right now, I'm 192.168.1.160. That means I can view http://192.168.1.160:8080 on
my phone.
