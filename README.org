1. I want to be able to hit the buttons from the index page
2. I want prettier documents

Now?

What pains me most is the horrendous navigation. And why does the root page
scroll on mobile?
** Happening? No.
Infinite malleability.

Ideas:

1. Metadata on toplevel EDN to hook into builder
2. Metadata or HTML elements or EDN readers to transform

NOW: can an EDN file have metadata? That would be nice.

#+begin_src clojure
{:eu.teod.subcons/builder :eu.teod.subcons.builder/hiccup-html}
#+end_src

ideas Out NOW

*wat*

I'd like a server for this. Is it enough to look for EDN files, and show each?
But ... there needs to be URLs. And these URLs need to be shown.

So ... given an URL, please let me subscribe to changes to it, then transform
the EDN, and keep a browser updated? And ... I don't need Clojurescript, I could
just have a piece of javascript on a websocket.

hmmmm
