You might want to edit EDN files and see how that looks. If so, run

#+begin_src
bin/live-server
#+end_src

and

#+begin_src
bin/watch
#+end_src

. That should start a web browser for you.

What pains me most is the horrendous navigation. And why does the root page

I need a nice orange for contrast to the green, nice warm orange.

Ideas:

1. Metadata on toplevel EDN to hook into builder
2. Metadata or HTML elements or EDN readers to transform

NOW: can an EDN file have metadata? That would be nice.

#+begin_src clojure
{:eu.teod.subcons/builder :eu.teod.subcons.builder/hiccup-html}
