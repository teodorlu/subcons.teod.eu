*wat*

ideas Out NOW

*wat*

I'd like a server for this. Is it enough to look for EDN files, and show each?
But ... there needs to be URLs. And these URLs need to be shown.

So ... given an URL, please let me subscribe to changes to it, then transform
the EDN, and keep a browser updated? And ... I don't need Clojurescript, I could
just have a piece of javascript on a websocket.

hmmmm
