#+TITLE: Readme

* Local development
Requirements:

- Babashka. Development environment and task runner.
- Clojure. Static site generation system.
- Nodejs. Only for =live-server= - which is used for local development

To work on pages, run:

#+begin_src
bb build+watch
#+end_src

Generated HTML is /checked into git/. This way, it's easy to see where changes
have been made. It also means that there is no separate build step.
* How to view live server output on a mobile device
You can view the live server directly on a mobile device, just find the local
network IP of the computer you're using.

#+begin_src
$ ifconfig -a | grep wlp0s20f3 -A 5

Right now, I'm 192.168.1.160. That means I can view http://192.168.1.160:8080 on
my phone.
