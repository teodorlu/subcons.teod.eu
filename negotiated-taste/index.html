Taste is below me, taste is subjective. Matters of <q>taste</q> are not of my taste.</p><p><strong>Another extreme.</strong> I am correct. I strive to be objective, and I succeed. Your opinion should be the same as mine, otherwise you are wrong. Thouhg you dare call what I say <q>taste</q>? You imbecile. You fail to understand. This is not up for discussion, for it is not my opinion; it is fact.</p><p><strong>Yet another extreme.</strong> So you are unable to contrast your taste with mine? Do you not have language for the critique of taste? Sorry â€” then you may not take part in this conversation. Please move ahead.</p><p>The limitation of fact is <em>interpretation</em>. A set of facts have multiple possible interpretations. <q>Which one is right?</q> is the wrong question; that pulls us straight back into the domain of facts. And interpretations are not facts.</p><p>Utility is a language of taste. Or? It is not a language for expressing taste, but it is a language for talking how taste affects us (phenomenologically), without presuming it is all fact.</p><p>Utility will only ever represent a fragment of taste. An aspect. But can the whole ever be contained? If utility is only ever the facticity of taste, what is its transcendence?</p></body></html>
