#+title: How To Learn — Unix Edition

* How to Learn — Unix Edition (Draft)
** Why learn
*** Fun
*** Effective
** What to learn
*** Search for orthogonal skills that span a space where you want to have impact
** How to learn
1. Define what you want to achieve
2. Learn fast by designing and implementing an interactive feedback loop
3. Reflect on process, outcome and goals - by yourself (journaling,
   introspection) and with others (retrospectives, feedback)

Repeat.

*** How to learn

1. Learn the right things (search for orthogonal skills that spans a space where
   you want to have impact)
2. Learn fast with a rapid feedback loop
3. Reflect & introspect on process and intent

I want to be able to explain this to people. And I want to iterate on it myself.
I'll need some slides. And I'll want to edit those slides structurally, probably
with Org-mode. And I'll want to /run/ the resulting slides. Probably in a sci
context like scittle.

(That's actually a case for where sci-in-sci makes sense)

But ... how do I want to handle it? Produce static HTML, then enrich it? With
hooks, perhaps? Do I want to produce multiple files? I think I want to control
that with EDN data.

*** How to work with the outline/structure

No, that's not the right question.

There's a reason I'm not using React for this. Or just powerpoint.

The common "broad strokes" solution is often course, and hard to use. Not
flexible. I'd rather have sharp, precise tools that feel right in the hand.

I like outlines. And I like tools like Miro or Figma for visual presentation. So
... perhaps control the overall structure as an outline?

I want to ask Jack Rusher about how he's taking notes.

**** Digression - what ⟂ how

Tension:

Design ⟂ implementation enables discussing the /what/ in a resonable way

BUT design isn't 100 % decoupled from implementation. What can be implemented
directs the solution space. We want to /navigate the solution space
effectively/. Not ignore it
