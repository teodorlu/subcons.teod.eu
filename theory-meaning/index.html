We've constructed theories of meaning for as long as we've had culture. "What am I?" I don't presume to solve that. So, why bother?</p><p>Because <em>the persuit</em> of a theory of meaning might be worthwhile.</p><section><h3>2021-07-12</h3><p>About <em>Stay true to your principles</em>. Whose principles? I like to talk about principles. But that's not really the point. The point is the "stay true" part. What does that mean? If you're not staying true, then you'll feel bad. At least I would. And that's the point.</p><p>-Teodor</p><p>But "listen to your heart" sounds too vague for my taste.</p></section><section><h3>2021-07-14</h3><p>I'm sceptical. This smells too orderly, too simple.
