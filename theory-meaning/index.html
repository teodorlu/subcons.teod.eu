            I'm not certain about the last one, it smells like it only applies
            to me. I've got principles. Other people have a sense of right and
            wrong. And I don't think that everyone should go around defining
            principles. What I <em>do</em> think, however, is that when we stay
            in line with what we presume is right, that leaves us better for it.
