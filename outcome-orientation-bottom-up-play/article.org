#+TITLE: Balancing outcome orientation and bottom-up play

# Idea - when parsing this, I can use a pandoc reader to extract the document
# title, then just put the plaintext into the hiccup parser too.

* Outcome orientation distributes intent to teams
* Overblown outcome orientation is micromanagement
* Distributed intent requires both outcome orientation and ownership from others
* Limits of directed research
* Use bottom-up play to spice it up, make it fun
